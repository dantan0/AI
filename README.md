# AI

This repository is based on Harvard's CS50 - AI (the master branch). All projects are completed by myself with some assistance from the ED forum. For a description of each project, you can visit the CS50-AI website in this link: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/. Other branches contain some short assignments from CS50 itself for practice.

## Traffic
This is the project where I got to build a CNN and experiment with different TensorFlow options. 

### Key ideas: 
- image convolution: applying a filter that adds each pixel value of an image
to its neighbours, weighted according to a kernel matrix
- max pooling: pooling by choosing the max value in each region
